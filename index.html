                Welcome to my Portfolio Website, I'm a junior Web Developer(beginner) currently studying in SYBSc IT at Gonsalo Garcia College which is located in Vasai. Honestly, I don't think that studying online from zoom is effective but I mostly believe in self learning which has led me here making this website and a few websites before this(You can check here). My love for Web development was developed when my friend said that we should make a website project and also thought it would be a good idea because I also get to try something new. When I started learning html, css, javascript I was having alot of fun but when i was fully done with these languages, my friend dropped the plan :( nevermind, so after some practice and effort today I'm here :)
